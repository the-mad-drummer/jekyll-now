    <td>I learnt by listening intently to the teacher and using my initiative in order to solve problems. I discussed options with the person sitting next to me as he was quite helpful</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am not very good at IT in general and therefore did not understand the work in as great a depth as many of my peers. I have not used spreadsheet much in the past and therefore my abilities were limited by my experience (or lack of).</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try my best to engage in and understand what we are doing, I will do some work at home in order to better understand the topic. I will maybe use spreadsheet at home more often in order to improve my understanding of the software.</td>
